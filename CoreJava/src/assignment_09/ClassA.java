 *WAP to demonstrate type casting / conversion of different primitive data types and of hierarchy of classes (class
cast). Please take your own example for the same. For class casting, here is one such scenario: Suppose
there are three classes â€“ A, B and C. B is subclass of A and C is of B. Class A has no data members and no
member function. B has one integer data member while C has two data members. Demonstrate class casting
for this situation and print the integer values.

        System.out.println("Int of classB-"+y.a);
